#+TITLE: Config Files

* Introduction

This repository contains my most important dot files.  As well as all the
 details needed for a full system configuration, including an
arch linux installation guide with windows 10 dual boot, post installation
suggestions and my entire theme configuration.

Each section within an order contains its own seperate README file. To read
my Emacs Configuration go to .emacs.d/ folder.
